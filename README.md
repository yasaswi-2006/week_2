# SFAL-VSD-SoC-Design Program 

Welcome to the repository documenting my journey through the **SoC Design**. This repository contains detailed notes, project reports, and learning experiences from various stages of the VLSI design process, covering topics from tool installation to advanced SoC design and implementation.

## Project : Multi-Corner Timing Analysis and Optimization for RISC-V SoC Using Skywater 130nm Technology Node

This project focuses on achieving optimal timing performance for a RISC-V SoC using the Skywater 130nm Process Design Kit (PDK). The workflow includes multiple stages, from post-synthesis to post-route optimization, each targeting improvements in the Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and Worst Hold Slack (WHS) across various Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT) corners. Starting with post-synthesis analysis, the project identifies critical timing violations and iteratively applies placement, clock tree, and routing optimizations. Advanced techniques are employed during each stage to minimize slack and ensure timing closure across all PVT scenarios, enhancing the robustness and performance of the RISC-V SoC design. The outcome of this project is a fully optimized SoC, ready for high- performance applications with reliable timing margins.
