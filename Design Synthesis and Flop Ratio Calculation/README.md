### Design Synthesis and Flop Ratio Calculation

#### **Tasks Overview:**
1. Perform synthesis on the `picorv32a` design using the OpenLANE flow and generate the necessary outputs.
2. Calculate the **Flop Ratio** and the percentage of D Flip-Flops (DFFs).

#### **Formulas:**
The **Flop Ratio** is calculated as:
```math
Flop\ Ratio = \frac{\text{Number of D Flip-Flops}}{\text{Total Number of Cells}}
```

The percentage of DFFs is:

```math
Percentage\ of\ DFF's = Flop\ Ratio * 100
```

# Calculate the Flop Ratio

From the statistics report:

  - Number of DFFs = 1613
  - Total Number of Cells = 14876
```math
Flop\ Ratio = \frac{1613}{14876} = 0.108429685
```

```math
Percentage\ of\ DFFs = 0.108429685 \times 100 = 10.84\%
```
