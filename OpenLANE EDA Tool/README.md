### Components of Digital ASIC Design

In digital ASIC design, three key components play a crucial role: **RTL**, **EDA tools**, and **PDK**.

<img width="559" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 15 06 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2302a238-ea24-4c88-8e1c-079990bc74db">

#### **1. RTL (Register Transfer Level)**
RTL represents the hardware design's functional description written in high-level hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL. It describes the digital circuits in terms of data flow between registers and logical operations.

- **Sources of RTL**:
  - [LibreCores](https://librecores.org): Open community for hardware IPs.
  - [OpenCores](https://opencores.org): Repository for open-source RTL projects.
  - [GitHub](https://github.com): Platform to find numerous RTL designs shared by developers worldwide.

#### **2. EDA (Electronic Design Automation) Tools**
EDA tools are software applications used for designing, simulating, verifying, and synthesizing digital circuits. Open-source EDA tools like **OpenLANE** streamline the RTL to GDSII design process.

#### **3. PDK (Process Design Kit)**
PDK acts as the bridge between chip designers and the semiconductor fabrication facilities (FABs). It provides all the necessary rules, files, and resources needed to design manufacturable chips.

- **Definition**:
  - During the early days of IC design ("age of Gods"), chip design was tightly integrated with proprietary manufacturing processes.
  - Pioneers like Lynn Conway and Carver Mead introduced the concept of separating design from technology, leading to the evolution of pure-play fabs (independent manufacturers) and fabless design companies.
  - The PDK represents the interface between the FAB and designers, enabling this separation.

- **Open-Source PDK Example**:
  - [Google Skywater 130nm PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk): Open-source production PDK for the 130nm process node.

#### **Is 130nm Old?**
Yes, 130nm is considered an older technology node, but it is still widely used for educational, research, and low-cost applications.

#### **Is 130nm Fast?**
Yes, despite being older:
- **Intel's Pentium 4 Extreme Edition (2004)** achieved 3.46 GHz using 130nm technology.
<img width="149" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 11 54 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f75594-5d0a-4c5b-9f6a-ffb8678b0903">

- **OSU Research** reported a post-layout clock frequency of 327 MHz for a single-cycle RV32 CPU on 130nm, with potential for >1 GHz in a pipelined design.

<img width="349" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 18 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f0cc644-1cb0-4eb4-93b7-e49bbc05e773">
---

### **Floor and Power Planning**

#### **Chip Floor-Planning**:
In this step, the chip die is partitioned into different system building blocks, and the **I/O pads** (pads used for external connections) are placed.

<img width="867" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 20 45 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0bb4baa-e18c-428e-9174-68a77a8f1b6f">

#### **Macro Floor-Planning**:
This focuses on defining the **dimensions**, **pin locations**, and **row definitions** for the macros used in the design.

<img width="277" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 21 09 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f10c98d-da7c-4445-af4e-f65709d11059">

#### **Power Planning**:
Power planning involves designing the distribution of power throughout the chip, ensuring that all components receive sufficient and stable power. This includes defining the power grid and routing the necessary metal layers to distribute power efficiently.

<img width="502" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 21 57 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f0b55fe-46ee-4fe4-905c-ba24b8aefd2b">

---

### **Placement**
Placement involves placing the standard cells on the floorplan rows, aligning them with designated sites. Placement is done in two main steps:

<img width="716" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 23 10 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf8178d6-aff6-4ce6-aecb-3f3c83d1fea7">

- **Global Placement**: Places cells in approximate positions.
- **Detailed Placement**: Fine-tunes the placement to ensure legal positioning of cells and optimization of area, power, and timing.

<img width="620" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 25 51 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dabae384-194d-4324-b4be-a1a33b22199e">

---

### **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**
Clock Tree Synthesis is responsible for creating a **clock distribution network** that ensures all sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops) receive a synchronized clock signal. The goal is to minimize clock skew, which is the difference in timing of the clock signal at various parts of the chip. Achieving zero skew is difficult, but minimizing it is critical.
- The clock distribution network is usually structured as a tree (H-tree, X-tree, etc.).

<img width="258" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 26 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0545e625-08ad-4943-b8e5-823529f3a864">

---

### **Routing**
Routing implements the interconnects between placed cells using the available metal layers. A **routing grid** is established for the chip, and the metal tracks are used to create the physical connections between cells.
- **Global Routing**: Generates routing guides that show the preferred routing paths.
- **Detailed Routing**: Uses the global routing guides to implement the actual wiring between the cells.

 <img width="778" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 27 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/888ab9b0-2cfd-492d-8936-5d084159a0e2">

---

### **Sign-Off**
At this stage, various physical and timing verifications are performed to ensure that the design is ready for fabrication.

#### **Physical Verifications**:
- **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Ensures that the design adheres to the manufacturing process's design rules.
- **Layout vs. Schematic (LVS)**: Verifies that the layout matches the schematic and that the design functions as intended.

#### **Timing Verification**:
- **Static Timing Analysis (STA)**: Ensures that the chip meets the required timing constraints, like ensuring data paths between registers are fast enough for the clock frequency.

### Introduction to OpenLANE Detailed ASIC Design Flow

The OpenLANE ASIC design flow starts with RTL synthesis, where tools like **Yosys** and **ABC** are used to convert RTL (Register Transfer Level) code into a gate-level netlist.

#### **Synthesis Exploration:**
This phase generates reports that provide insights into the design’s performance, area, and power consumption.

<img width="836" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 59 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd44932d-9ab8-47e0-b832-6cc213b6293e">


**Design Exploration**:  
Used to evaluate different design configurations to optimize for various goals, such as power, performance, and area.
  
<img width="810" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 59 41 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d169387e-3d42-40de-82cb-36e6c39a6efc">

#### **OpenLANE Regression Testing:**
The design exploration utility is also used for regression testing. OpenLANE runs on approximately 70 different designs and compares the results to previously known best configurations, ensuring consistency and reliability across different design iterations.

<img width="339" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 6 11 59 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf81cdaa-ee67-4663-b18e-dea9493cf53e">

#### **DFT (Design for Test):**
- **Scan Insertion**: Adds scan chains to the design for testing its functionality during manufacturing.
- **ATPG (Automatic Test Pattern Generation)**: Automatically generates test patterns to verify the functionality of the design.
- **Test Patterns Compaction**: Reduces the number of test patterns while maintaining fault coverage.
- **Fault Coverage**: Measures how well the generated tests cover potential faults in the design.
- **Fault Simulation**: Simulates potential faults to ensure the design works as expected.

<img width="870" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 6 01 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae7948a4-d21d-4d79-a4a1-a95a985e8d8b">


#### **Physical Implementation (Automated Place and Route):**
Physical implementation, also known as **Place and Route (PnR)**, involves the following steps:
- **Floor/Power Planning**: Defines the chip's layout and power distribution network.
- **End Decoupling Capacitors and Tap Cells Insertion**: Ensures the power network is stable and that the chip is properly grounded.
- **Placement (Global and Detailed)**: Places standard cells and macros onto the floorplan in two stages—global and detailed placement.
- **Post-Placement Optimization**: Refines placement to reduce wire lengths and improve performance.
- **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**: Designs the clock network to synchronize the operation of sequential elements.
- **Routing (Global and Detailed)**: Routes the metal connections between placed cells in two stages—global routing and detailed routing.

These steps are all carried out using **OpenROAD**, a suite of open-source tools for physical design.


#### **Logic Equivalence Check (LEC):**
Every time the netlist is modified (e.g., during CTS or post-placement optimization), it is crucial to perform a **Logic Equivalence Check (LEC)** to verify that the function of the design has not changed. This is done using **Yosys** to ensure that modifications do not introduce logical errors.

#### **Dealing with Antenna Rules Violations:**
When a metal wire segment is fabricated, it can accumulate charge during the etching process, potentially damaging transistor gates. This phenomenon is known as **Antenna Effect**.

<img width="504" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 6 04 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99bf61b7-497f-42f2-b819-9f0ebacf74fd">
<img width="604" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 6 06 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7e18852-f467-4381-bd3c-26c4bd650278">

To prevent this:
- A **Fake Antenna Diode** is added next to every cell input after placement.
- **Magic**, a layout verification tool, is used to run an **Antenna Checker** on the routed layout.
- If a violation is detected, the Fake Antenna Diode is replaced with a real one.

<img width="347" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 6 14 38 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eb1d07b-2d58-49ca-8c89-33599b6d7941">

#### **Physical Verification: DRC & LVS**
- **Design Rules Checking (DRC)**: Performed using **Magic** to ensure that the design meets all the manufacturing process rules.
- **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic)**: Ensures that the layout matches the original schematic design. This is done using **Magic** and **Netgen**.
- **SPICE Extraction**: Magic also extracts the SPICE model from the layout to simulate and verify the design’s electrical behavior.
